CRYPTID CHAT- ANONYMOUS CHAT MESSAGING APP!!!


##WHAT IT IS 

cryptid noun
cryp·​tid | \ ˈkrip-təd\
Definition of cryptid
: an animal (such as Sasquatch or the Loch Ness Monster) that has been claimed to exist but never proven to exist.

This is a final project, messaging app that allows users to create a chatroom with a password(hashed by bcrypt), and can input any username they want or choose to be anonymous. No login or information is required. The user can then share the chatroom password to friends or others they want to talk to. All chatrooms are not saved, and no information is shared. 

We used socket.io to build the main user functions of this project, and do not store any chat info. Our goal was to make users feel safe within a chat, and to make the user or the content of a chat anonymous or like it never exsisted. 

##WHAT WE USED

Our team used React, Express, bcrypt, PostgresSQL, Node.js, and Styled Components.

##CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS

Challenge 1

As we discussed the project in the beginning and were inspired by new technologies avaiable to us,we first started the project in NEXT.js. After working with it for a few days we had problems with some of it's features and working with our global state in the framework. We also were having issues rendering our css and styled components due to the static html. We soon realized we bit off more than we could chew and had to backtrack to refactor our project in create-react-app. We quickly refactored, although it did put us back a few days. 

Challenge 2

After refactoring our app we dove into more user features such as adding multipule channels, password protected chats (bcrypt), and adding an input for a username or alias. 
We ran into an issue adding the channels feature,which was eventually solved by debugging and seeing a bug in the global state. YAY debugging!
